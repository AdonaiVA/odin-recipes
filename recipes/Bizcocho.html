    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Eggs</li>
        <li>250g Flour</li>
        <li>200g Sugar</li>
        <li>1 scoop yeast</li>
        <li>120ml milk</li>
        <li>100ml oil</li>
        <li>1 scoop vanilla</li>
        <li>1 scoop cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>How to prepare</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat the eggs with half of the sugar. Beat for a few minutes, until the egg is well oxygenated and has doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Add the rest of the sugar, the milk, the oil, the cinnamon and the vanilla essence. If the milk is hot, it is better, but at least it should not be cold from the refrigerator. This way the cake will be fluffier. Mix until everything is well integrated. </li>
        <li>It is the turn of the more solid ingredients of the milk cake. We put the flour and baking powder in a sieve or a sieve and sift it over the mixture.</li>
        <li>We grease a mold well with butter and then sprinkle with flour, so that it does not stick. We put the mixture here.</li>
        <li>In the oven already preheated to 180ºC, we put the mold in the middle slit for about 40 minutes. The time is indicative. A reliable way to know if it is done is to prick it a little with a fork and if it comes out clean, it means that our cake is ready.</li>
        <li>If you see that it is done in less time, you can cover it with aluminum foil, so that it does not burn on the outside but finishes cooking inside.</li>
    </ol>
