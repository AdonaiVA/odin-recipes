    <h2>How to prepare</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make a delicious egg omelet it is important to have a good non-stick frying pan, this is the only way to ensure that it does not stick and is delicious. Also remember that you can make this French omelet completely round or fold it in half.</li>
        <li>Place a drizzle of oil in the frying pan and bring it to medium heat. Meanwhile add the eggs to a bowl, add two tablespoons of milk for a fluffier result, add salt and pepper to taste and stir until you get a perfectly homogeneous mixture. If you want the egg omelet to be smooth, it is important that you do not stir too much, because the more you do it, the more consistent it will be.</li>
        <li>Once the oil is hot add the egg to the pan. It will begin to cook, when the edges are slightly cooked, lift the omelet on one side with a spatula allowing the egg that is still liquid to run to the edges and cook. Flip when it is almost ready.</li>
        <li>If you like your omelet soft and not overcooked, you can leave it on the heat for another minute and then fold it in half and remove it. If on the contrary you prefer it well cooked, then let it cook to the point you want. When it is to your liking, remove from the pan with the help of a spatula or a plate.</li>
        <li>Sirve tu omelette de huevo acompañado de pan, jamón, pavo o queso. ¡Un desayuno delicioso!</li>
